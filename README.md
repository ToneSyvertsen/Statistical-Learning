# Statistical-Learning
This repository contains learning materials and my assignments from the course **Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science.** 


- Where I hopefully will learn to create Machine Learning Algorithms in Python and R from two Data Science experts. Code templates included.
I will only focus on Python in the beginning.

Later it may also contain my notes and solutions to the questions in the book: An Introduction to Statistical Learning
with Applications in R authors: Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani

note that this answeres are just my suggestions for solution and are very possible wrong
